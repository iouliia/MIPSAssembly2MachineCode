# MIPSAssembly2MachineCode
Java program converting assembly to machine code for a specific 16-bit MIPS processor

This program is very basic - it reads assembly code from the file source.txt
saved in the local folder and generates the file InstrMemory.txt containing 
the result of conversion to the respective machine code (in the format to be used in VHDL). 

The converter is only usable for the specific 16-bit MIPS processor.
